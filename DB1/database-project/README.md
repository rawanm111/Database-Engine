# database-project
Developed a Java backend for a database interface, enabling efficient update, delete, and insert operations on tuples. The project incorporated an innovative approach where tables were organised as collections of pages, and tuples were indexed using an octree data structure. The backend system leveraged famous design patterns to ensure scalability, modularity, and extensibility. It included the implementation of an octree indexing mechanism to accelerate data retrieval, particularly for select queries. The project demonstrated proficiency in Java programming, database design, index optimization, and the application of design patterns.
